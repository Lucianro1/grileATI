    <p><strong>Question 8</strong><br>This question concerns the P-V relationship, and the Frank–Starling curve:</p>
    <ul class="answers">
      <li class="answer">a. The Frank–Starling law states that the force of contraction is related to the initial fibre length</li>
      <li class="answer">b. The force of myocardial contraction is proportional to the initial fibre length, until an upper limit is reached</li>
      <li class="answer">c. Before the mitral valve opens there is a decrease in pressure in the ventricle, but no change in volume</li>
      <li class="answer">d. Before aortic valve closure there is an increase in volume with no associated change in pressure</li>
      <li class="answer">e. The aortic valve opens when the pressure in the ventricle is lower than that in the aorta</li>
    </ul>
